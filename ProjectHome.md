This project represents a refactoring and rewrite in Python of a script originally written in 1993 using DOS 3.3 and the Korn shell of MKS Toolkit.  The original script, "shuffle", was published in December 1994 in UnixWorld [1](1.md).  After using awk in a rewrite of the script, I published the rewritten script in December 2006 in lifehacker.com under the name "shawkle".

Although this Python rewrite will not use awk, I am for now retaining the name "shawkle" as I look into possible confusion with other programs called "shuffle" which have in the meantime appeared.
